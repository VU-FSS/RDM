| 2.4.1. When maintaining or accessing personal identifiers in databases or systems of records, such as division rosters, annual meeting submissions, or manuscript review systems, AOM members delete such identifiers before the information is made publicly available or employ other techniques that mask or control disclosure of individual identities.                                                                                                                                       | FSS guidelines require pseudonymization before publication of data sets.                                                        |
| 2.4.2. When deletion of personal identifiers is not feasible, AOM members take reasonable steps to determine that the appropriate consent of personally identifiable individuals has been obtained before they transfer such data to others or review such data collected by others.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | FSS requires researchers to follow GDPR which has a more comprehensive approach on what can and cannot be done without consent. |
| <u>2.5. Electronic Transmission of Confidential Information:</u>Â  AOM members use extreme care in delivering or transferring any confidential data, information, or communication over public computer networks when conducting AOM work. AOM members are attentive to the problems of maintaining confidentiality and control over sensitive material and data when the use of technological innovations, such as public computer networks, may open their communication to unauthorized persons. | Following GDPR, FSS requires researchers to take appropriate technical measures to secure personal data.                        |
