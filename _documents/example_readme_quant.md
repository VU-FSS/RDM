### Title

Data set for a Simple quantitative research project using Git, Research Drive and Yoda



### Type

Dataset

### Description

The data set was produced as part of the research project titled "Creating example data sets", in which fictitious respondents were fictitiously asked fictitious question, resulting a purely hypothetical data set, which is structured as follows:

The raw data (in the "Raw Data" folder) contains two data files: HH.csv contains raw data at the household level, and Roster.csv contains data for module 2 of the questionnaire, at household member level. 

The pseudonymized data contains the same data as the raw data, but with the following changes:
	- All data is converted to Stata (.dat) format, including value and variable labels.
	- 
all directly identifying personal information (names etc.) has been removed. This includes:
	- Removal of question 1.1 (Respondent name)
	- Removal of question 12.1 - 12.3 (Contact details for quality control follow up)
Furthermore, labels
