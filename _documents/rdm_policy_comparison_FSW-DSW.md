<td><p><strong>1. Preamble</strong></p>
<p><strong>The principles of honesty, scrupulousness, transparency,
independence, and responsibility form the basis of research integrity
(UNL, 2018). Abiding by these principles enlarges trust and quality of
academic research, thereby improving its relevance to society. The
current guideline is developed with input from all DSW faculties and
offers guidance for the archiving of academic research published by
researchers at the Dutch faculties of social and behavioural sciences,
drawn from the principles of scrupulousness, transparency, and
responsibility. The guideline seeks to improve archiving of social and
behavioural research using both quantitative and qualitative methods, in
order to safeguard continued availability of qualitative or quantitative
research data, detailed descriptions of research materials and
approaches, and an overview of the data processing and publication
processes after the research has been published.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This guideline is not meant to replace other existing
guidelines or regulations related to data management, open science, data
processing agreements and privacy aspects in the design stage of a
research project. The document can be seen as an initiative that is part
of a broader effort to promote research integrity among researchers
focusing on both quantitative and qualitative studies at faculties of
behavioural and social sciences in the Netherlands. Rather than
functioning as a strict straightjacket, it intends to provide a clear
guideline, which can be further fleshed out under the motto ‘apply or
explain’, taking into account existing regulations at the faculty or
university level.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researchers working in the social and behavioural sciences at
a Dutch university will be held to these standards to ensure that
research integrity in general and transparency in particular can be
ensured. Given the various distinct methodologies of scholarly research
carried out under the general “social science” header, there are two
main approaches that can be identified and should be implemented to
ensure scientific integrity and its future assessment. The first is
primarily for quantitative research designs and quantitative data that
can most often relatively easily be de-identified (pseudonymized or
anonymized) and stored in a repository in full. The second is for
scientific research that is structured by qualitative and interpretive
research designs and epistemologies that generate data and information
that may have a different character and most often cannot be
de-identified and stored in an identical manner as quantitative data.
Regardless of methodological approach, all researchers have an
obligation to follow the standards of integrity and transparency set in
this document. All researchers must be aware of the specific regulations
that govern their type of research and adhere to these
regulations</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <strong>(except where motivated
exceptions are allowed).</strong></p></td>
<td><p>FSW guidelines follow the spirit of these guidelines, but FSS
disagrees that qualitative and quantitative data should be treated
differently. The reasoning for this can be summarized as follows</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>While there is difference in the ease of de-identification of
quantitative vs qualitative data, this difference is not relevant: it is
still very difficult to fully anonymize quantitative data, and it is
possible to pseudonymize qualitative data.</p></li>
<li><p>Even if pseudonymization of qualitative data is impossible,
non-pseudonymized data can still be archived following our
guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>Much of our research combines elements of quantitative data
analysis and qualitiative data analysis, making a distinction
problematic to put into practice.</p></li>
<li><p>A distinction would further divide social sciences and complicate
efforts to promote inter-disciplinarity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Differential handling of data should therefore not be based on the
data being quantitative or qualitative, but on the specific nature of
the data: for example the privacy risks posed by the data, the IP rights
over the data, whether the data is available elsewhere, etc.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>1.1 Purpose of these guidelines</strong></p>
<p><strong>These guidelines for the archiving of academic research set
out the preconditions for the archiving of data, materials and
information that form the basis for publications – in other words,
(descriptions of) data, materials and information that are needed in
order for academic peers and other consumers of the research to
replicate, reproduce, and/ or assess the published research results.
These guidelines relate to the data, materials and information with
respect to publications that appear in their definitive form as of 1
September 2021</strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><strong>.</strong> <strong>The
guidelines are based on the principle of retroactive accountability,
i.e. reporting after a publication has appeared. The norm behind these
guidelines is that each researcher is responsible for archiving data,
materials and information, and the publications based on them, in a
responsible and transparent way, in order to keep the data for future
verification or checking by academic peers, and re-use. In situations
where this document does not provide clear-cut rules, researchers are
expected to act in the spirit of these guidelines rather than observing
them to the letter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Faculties will be expected to apply these national
guidelines. The guidelines will be evaluated every two years, under the
responsibility of the deans of the faculties of social and behavioural
sciences (DSW).</strong></p></td>
<td>FSS policy endorses this purpose.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>1.2 To whom do these guidelines apply?</strong></p>
<p><strong>These guidelines apply to all faculty staff members who
conduct research in the context of a temporary or permanent employment
contract, all PhD candidates who conduct research under the supervision
of a professor, and all research master’s students. The guidelines do
not apply to bachelor’s and one-year master’s students, unless their
research results in an academic publication. Research conducted by
bachelor’s and one-year master’s students falls under the formal
responsibility of their supervisors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All researchers at the faculty must adhere to <em>The
Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity</em></strong><a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a><strong><em>.</em> These guidelines
are a concrete embodiment of the principle of transparency and the
related norms set out in the UNL Code of Conduct. The Netherlands Code
of Conduct also requires researchers to make data as open as possible
after publication or to document valid reasons for not sharing the
data.</strong></p></td>
<td>The FSS policy has adopted the exact wording here.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>
<p><strong>1.3 Raw data, personal data and research data</strong></p>
<p><strong>Within the framework of the transparency and replicability of
research, raw data must of course be retained. Raw data are the unedited
data that are collected within the framework of a research project, for
example:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Registrations derived from experimental
research</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Survey data from questionnaires completed within the
framework of research (including longitudinal research), collected by
the researcher themselves or by an external fieldwork
organization</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>(Transcripts of) video material collected within the
framework of qualitative research (open interviews,
observations)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notes taken within the framework of qualitative research
or research using source material</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Raw data must always be de-identified as soon as and
insofar possible so that they cannot be directly traced back to people
or groups of people. Data that can be directly or indirectly traced back
to a person are known as personal data. This includes not only name and
address details, but also photographs, audio - and video material, and
other identifying information. The de-identified raw data and the
personal data together form the research data</strong></p></li>
</ul></td>
<td><p>FSS policy doesn’t include the advice to de-identify all raw
data, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once data is de-identified, it may no longer be considered
raw.</p></li>
<li><p>De-identifying some forms of data (e.g. audiovisual data) is
extremely complex and time consuming.</p></li>
<li><p>The identity of the data subject, or factors making indirect
identification trivial, may be of crucial importance to the research.
De-identification will damage the data set.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>FSS therefore takes a pragmatic stand with respect to
de-identification. It is considered one of many measures available to
the researcher to secure their data, and it is up to the researcher to
decide which measures appropriately secure their data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FSS clarifies that given the definition of personal data
give, almost all data used in the faculty (including pseudonymized data)
is considered personal data.</p></td>

packages</strong></p>
<p><strong>These guidelines relate to all research publications listed
in the faculty’s academic annual report. In order to ensure the
transparency of qualitative and quantitative empirical research, all
information that is needed to be able to assess the results must be
archived (in English). This information is stored in a ‘publication
package’.</strong></p></td>
<td>FSS policy doesn’t mention the term “publication package”. The term
may lead to confusion: first, a researcher may think that the package
itself must be published. Second, they may think that all elements need
to be archived together. However, it is okay to have some items in a
public repository, while others are in a restricted archive, as long as
the various components link to each other.</td>

<p><strong>2.1.2 Qualitative research</strong></p>
<p><strong>For qualitative, interpretative methodologies, a distinction
should be made between the two main criteria for research integrity,
i.e., transparency and reproduction. Transparency is a valid and
legitimate demand also for qualitative research (and data), but
reproduction is not considered possible in all cases, due to the very
nature of the research designs and epistemology. Qualitative data are
often impossible to fully de-identify and the research data is often
gathered in forms and formats that cannot be stored in a digital
repository.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Of course, some of these data may be highly sensitive and
cannot be shared with others without breaking ethical rules and the
confidentiality that is often guaranteed to informants and other (human)
sources of information. But as the aim of these guidelines is not
sharing data but storing data, qualitative research should also be
archived. Sensitive data should be stored on secured faculty servers.
And when the format does not allow researchers to store original
objects, it suffices to store pictures of the material. These data
should be stored safely in a way that is accessible to the researcher
who gathered the data.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Researchers are therefore expected to store their data safely
and to make specific plans for the time period of storage of their data,
where and in which manner the data will be stored, and what will be done
with the data once the research project ends or, for longterm ongoing
research, once the researcher retires from research reporting etc. This
calls for an elaborate and transparent data management plan or another,
similar or equivalent form of data storage plan that describes: what
kind of data will be gathered, by whom, in what format, where and in
which form these will be stored, and to what extent and under what
conditions this data will be shared and with whom, and any specific
steps that will be taken to share the data that is safe to be shared.
The researcher should be aware that according to the Netherlands Code of
Conduct for Research Integrity there may be (highly exceptional) cases
in which there are compelling reasons for components of the research,
including data, not to be disclosed to an investigation into alleged
research misconduct. Such cases must be recorded and the consent of the
board of the institution must be obtained prior to storing the
components and/or data in question. This documented exception must also
be mentioned in any results published.</strong><a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

collection (e.g. dates of interviews or observation, period(s) of time

adding new versions. If a faculty has appointed a ‘co-pilot’ to check
the analysis or a data steward to consider data management compliance,
they will also be assigned reading rights. The faculty board can assign
reading rights to a specific official to prepare for audits of
publication packages on its behalf, for example, the coordinator of a

publication, academic peers should be granted access to the publication
package if they make a reasonable request to verify or examine the

they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were
collected. Some specific studies may require retention of data that can
be traced back to individuals, for example for the purpose of follow-up
research or for longitudinal studies. Technical and organizational
measures to protect the rights of data subjects need to be documented
and will preferably be standardized for specific research scenarios.
Protecting the right of data subjects is particularly important for raw
data that cannot be de-identified (for example, video- and audio
data).</strong></p>
<p><strong>One complicating factor lies in the wish to retain personal
data for the purpose of reviewing the integrity of the research itself,
for example to check whether the participants did indeed participate in
the research. If such integrity reviews are regarded as part of the
research whose integrity is reviewed and considered necessary in the
field it is allowed to store data that can be traced back to individuals
for this purpose. When research is published, such personal data must be
stored separately; not in the publication package. As an alternative
option, researchers, faculties and research institutes can develop a
protocol to monitor the integrity of the research before archiving,
after which the personal data can be deleted. It is not necessary to
store the personal data for the sole purpose of enabling participants to
exercise their rights under the GDPR.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Individual faculties can choose to add the following rules to
the above-mentioned guidelines concerning publication packages and
storage of raw data:</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Faculties may decide that the guidelines also apply to
data collected within the framework of one-year master’s and bachelor’s
research projects. The supervisor can then be appointed as the
responsible party.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faculties may decide to extend these guidelines to
include storage of all data, including research that has not been
published. This must be set out in a data management
plan.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faculties may define rules concerning ownership of data,
for example that storage of data in a publication package will not
result in a change of ownership.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faculties may decide to make random inspections to check
the existence and quality of publication packages.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faculties may use different time periods and, for
example, indicate that a publication package must be archived upon
acceptance (rather than publication) of a manuscript.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faculties may decide that each manuscript must state
where the data are stored (a data statement) and which roles the various
authors played.</strong></p></li>

<td><p>1. FSS does not extend to Bachelor and 1-year Master students, as
sufficient infrastructure is not available for this.</p>
<p>2. For now, FSS policy only applies to published research.</p>
<p>3. VU has central policy that data is owned by the VU. FSS encourages
department heads to ensure that researchers who leave FSS can continue
to work with their data.</p>
<p>4. Random inspections do not fit within the culture of trust that FSS
aims to cultivate.</p>
<p>5. DSW guidelines and VU guidelines are both for 10 years, and there
is no reason to deviate.</p>
<p>6. This is included in the FSS guidelines.</p></td>
