responsible for making agreements with researchers on such issues, see
article 7 under ‘Responsibilities’ in this policy.</p></td>

this standard.</p>

discipline-specific guidelines or contractual arrangements dictate
otherwise. The moment of publication is defined as the first online
appearance of the publication. If there is no online publication date,
the formal publication date of the publisher applies. If a researcher’s
employment terminates between the events of submitting a publication and
the actual moment of publication, agreements must be made regarding
these data archiving responsibilities according to articles 2 and 7

<p>with a Persistent Identifier. Before research data are shared for
reuse or verification, a</p>
<p>researcher has to make sure that this is compliant with applicable
legislation and ethical requirements. When research data include
personal data, an assessment must first take place to determine whether
these data can be shared and if so, under which conditions.</p></td>

support staff can request the</p>
