<th><p><strong>Data ownership, data protection, and Open
Science</strong>: Anthropological research materials</p>
<p>cannot be considered as disembodied and transferable ‘data’. As much
anthropological</p>
<p>knowledge is co-produced with our interlocutors, we cannot transfer
possession, access, or ownership rights of ‘our data’ to others (such as
employers, fellow-scientists, or the general public) without their
consent. Based on relations of trust, our interlocutors often share
personal and sensitive material with us. We are responsible for keeping
such personal and potentially sensitive materials protected and
confidential. Providing open access to fieldwork materials is therefore
limited; in the case of an integrity inquiry we can at most provide
confidential access. Anonymizing ethnographic research materials is
often not a workable solution, as it is not only</p>
<p>overly time-consuming but above all removes so much detail, that the
material becomes virtually meaningless</p></th>
<th>FSS fully endorses this: protection of respondents’ privacy is a
valid reason not to grant open access to data.</th>

<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Anthropological knowledge production: Anonymity as default option
and non-disclosure of fieldwork data are a precondition for
anthropological knowledge production before they are turned into ethical
concerns. If we do not allow for anonymity and the protection of our
fieldwork material, many of our interlocutors would be hesitant, if not
positively reluctant, to share their insights with us. Moreover, much of
the knowledge we co-produce with our interlocutors is embodied and
personal. Our fieldnotes function as a memory bank, rather than a
complete record of knowledge acquired. Using this material without such
personal knowledge</p>
<p>runs the serious risk of misinterpretation of the material.</p>
<p>This character of anthropology as a science dealing with research
materials that can often not be reduced to ‘data’ has serious ethical
consequences, especially regarding the following.</p></td>
<td><p>The definition of data as used by the ABV is slightly different
than that used by most of the policies that the FSS RDM guidelines are
based on. In most definitions field notes would fall under the category
“data”.</p>
<p>However, for purposes of the FSS RDM guidelines, it is not necessary
for data (and thus field notes) to be published or be interpreted by
others. For verification purposes, the data should be archived as a
record of the steps the researcher took to arrive at the conclusions in
publications. Such archived data will only be accessed in case of doubts
regarding academic integrity.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Anonymity and informed consent: Our default position is that we do
not engage in covert<br />
research and that we safeguard our interlocutors’ anonymity in our
texts. Anthropological research is built on trust, and researchers have
a responsibility to protect the privacy and the safety of their
interlocutors. Anthropologists regard written informed consent as
potentially deceptive. Because relations with interlocutors change in
the course of research, for instance under the influence of changing
political circumstances, this transfer of knowledge is never fully
concluded. We consider it legitimate and often advisable to work with
oral forms of consent,<br />
since written consent forms may impact negatively on interlocutors’
privacy, safety, and<br />
possession of knowledge.</td>
<td><p>This may be problematic with respect to GDPR: there must be
demonstrable consent. This does not need to be in the form of an
informed consent sheet, or even written in some other way, but there
must be a way that it can be demonstrated a participant consented.</p>
<p>In practice, researchers can contact the Privacy Champion to find
what works.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Doing no harm:</strong> The epistemological need for
trust in research relationships generally implies</p>
<p>that anthropological ethics starts, in the vast majority of cases,
from the position of doing no</p>
<p>harm to our interlocutors. We may be confronted with dilemmas in
which not doing harm to some (especially if these are in a position of
power) will do (serious) harm to others. In those cases we hold a
particular responsibility towards those in a position of precarity and
vulnerability.</p></td>
<td>This goes beyond the scope of the FSS RDM policy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Bias and ‘conflicts of interest’</strong>: We recognize
that we all speak from a particular position and</p>
<p>value reflexivity highly as a means to deal with bias. We fully
support the need to report on</p>
<p>material conflicts of interest, including conditions imposed by
funders or employers as well as conditions imposed by people studied. In
contrast, the extent to which it is desirable to disclose information
about personal backgrounds, perspectives and positions can only be
judged by the researcher and not be imposed by others.</p></td>
<td>This goes beyond the scope of the FSS RDM guidelines.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Legal protection</strong>: We do not enjoy a legal right
to keeping sources confidential such as medical</p>
<p>or legal practitioners or journalists. The European GRDP, however,
allows an interpretation of the law that grants similar protective
privileges to “academic expression” as is granted to journalistic
expression. We urge our institutions to work towards the legal
protection of researchers, their interlocutors, sources, and the
processing of their data. Especially when we work on sensitive subjects,
our research may be severely hindered and our interlocutors be put at
risk, when we are not able to claim protection from forced disclosure in
court.</p></td>
<td><p>This really concerns a legal matter that is above the level of
the Faculty, and so can’t really be incorporated in the RDM
guidelines.</p>
<p>FSS should note that this risk is even larger for data stored in the
US, so researchers should take care when transferring data
there.</p></td>
