<td>9. In research with external partners, make clear written agreements
about research integrity and related matters such as intellectual
property rights.</td>

for FSS researchers about this is IXA-GO.</td>

organized and classified so that they can be verified and reused.</td>

covers this. A template readme file is also provided.</td>

<td>11. As far as possible, make research findings and research data
public subsequent to completion of the research. If this is not
possible, establish valid reasons for their non-disclosure.</td>

are included in FSS guidelines, including a requirement to record in the
DMP the reasons not to publish data.</td>

<td>12 a. In the event of an investigation into alleged research
misconduct, make all relevant research and data available for
verification subject to the confidentiality safeguards established by
the board of the institution</td>

can be accessed for verification purposes.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>12 b. In highly exceptional cases, there may be compelling reasons
for components of the research, including data, not to be disclosed to
an investigation into alleged research misconduct. Such cases must be
recorded and the consent of the board of the institution must be
obtained prior to using the components and/or data in question in the
scientific or scholarly research. They must also be mentioned in any
results published.</td>
<td>There are currently no provisions for this in the FSS guidelines,
since it is not clear what steps should be taken, and what criteria
should be satisfied, to qualify for these exceptions.</td>

Data should be archived in such a way that verification is
possible.</td>

honestly, scrupulously and as transparently as possible.</td>
<td><p>FSS RDM Guidelines ask for full documentation of all datasets,
and for the data sets to be described with descriptive metadata or
readme file.</p>
<p>Researchers should also follow this point in their publications, but
that goes beyond the scope of the FSS RDM Guidelines.</p></td>

<td>24. Manage the collected data carefully and store both the raw and
processed versions for a period appropriate for the discipline and
methodology at issue.</td>
<td>The FSS guidelines specify this.</td>

accessible, interoperable and reusable in accordance with the FAIR
principles</td>
