This is a selection of the standards for good research practices
(chapter 3 of the code of conduct) which pertain to data management.

| **Code of Conduct**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | **FSS Guidelines**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 9\. In research with external partners, make clear written agreements about research integrity and related matters such as intellectual property rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | FSS guidelines include instructions to do this. The primary contact for FSS researchers about this is IXA-GO.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 10\. As necessary, describe how the collected research data are organized and classified so that they can be verified and reused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | FSS guidelines include instructions to write a readme file which covers this. A template readme file is also provided.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11\. As far as possible, make research findings and research data public subsequent to completion of the research. If this is not possible, establish valid reasons for their non-disclosure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The possible exceptions listed are included in FSS guidelines, including a requirement to record in the DMP the reasons not to publish data.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 12 a. In the event of an investigation into alleged research misconduct, make all relevant research and data available for verification subject to the confidentiality safeguards established by the board of the institution                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | FSS guidelines ensure that all data is archived in a place where it can be accessed for verification purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 12 b. In highly exceptional cases, there may be compelling reasons for components of the research, including data, not to be disclosed to an investigation into alleged research misconduct. Such cases must be recorded and the consent of the board of the institution must be obtained prior to using the components and/or data in question in the scientific or scholarly research. They must also be mentioned in any results published. | There are currently no provisions for this in the FSS guidelines, since it is not clear what steps should be taken, and what criteria should be satisfied, to qualify for these exceptions.                                                                                                        |
| **3.3 Conduct**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 22\. Ensure that sources are verifiable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | There are no specific guidelines in the FSS guidelines as of yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 23\. Describe the data collected for and/or used in your research honestly, scrupulously and as transparently as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | There are no specific guidelines in the FSS guidelines as of yet, because it is not clear where this need to happen. If it is in the publication that is based on the data, then itâ€™s not in the scope of the guidelines. If it is with the archived data, then the readme file should include it. |
| 24\. Manage the collected data carefully and store both the raw and processed versions for a period appropriate for the discipline and methodology at issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | The FSS guidelines specify this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 25\. Contribute, where appropriate, towards making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable in accordance with the FAIR principles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The FSS guidelines follow the FAIR principles explicitly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 45\. As far as possible, make research findings and research data public subsequent to completion of the research. If this is not possible, establish the valid reasons for this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | From the perspective of the VU guidelines, this is redundant with item 11.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
