# Information:

As part of the WIZWI, the faculty has the responsibility to update its RDM policy based on the VU RDM Policy 2.0 (https://libguides.vu.nl/ld.php?content_id=32045526). Starting summer 2022, the Data Steward has combine this central RDM Policy with various other pieces of policy that apply to the work our researchers done into one (relatively) short set of guidelines. These guidelines have been sent for comments to various gremia and experts around the VU:

The main “selling point” of these guidelines is that they don’t aim to add to the work load of researchers, but rather remove difficulties in trying to comply with a multitude of (often conflicting) regulations at once.

# Summary:

The new FSS RDM Guidelines comprise three main documents and zip file with supprting documents. These documents are aimed at informing researchers on how to best implement the various policies, guidelines and codes of conduct pertaining to Research Data Management. Attached you will find the following:

- **1. fss_guidelines_rdm.docx**: These are the main guidelines (and all other documents are linked to from within this document). They condense a large number of policies into a coherent set of guidelines. I have aimed to keep the detail level of this particular document as low as possible for three reasons: a) brevity (I want people to read this document); b) to prevent situations where we have to update our policy every time the available tools change and c) to keep it applicable to all the various disciplines we have at the faculty. I have kept the nitty gritty details to separate documents that will be made easily available on VU.nl.
- **fss_policy_comparisons.zip**: the first part of the FSS RDM Guidelines contains a list of all the policies, guidelines and codes of conduct that the guidelines are based on. This zip file contains a word file for each such policy document, including a point-point-comparison with the FSS Policy comparison. Sometimes the various policies conflict, and a choice needs to be made. The goal of this array of documents is to motivate and document such choices.
- **2. fss_guidelines_archiving-and-organization.docx**: this draft document contains detailed guidance on how to comply with the policy that "all data that can be reasonably deemed necessary to verify the findings of the research" needs to be archived. It contains use cases for how to organize data folders during the research, and on advice on what to select for archiving (based on the Guideline for the archiving of academic research for faculties of behavioural and social sciences in the Netherlands). The Data Organization use cases are meant to be expanded upon with real-world best practices from around the VU.
