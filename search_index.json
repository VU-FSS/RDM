The text should be adapted to the specific project for as much as possible. The Research Office grant advisors and/or the Faculty Data Steward can help you with more detailed texts tailored to the grant you’re applying for. Personal Data The [interview/survey/…] data collected for this project constitutes personal data in the sense of the GDPR. The researcher will work with the faculty data steward and the VU’s privacy team to ensure compliance with GDPR. The legal ground for processing this data is informed consent. All respondents will be fully informed about the means and purposes of the data processing, and no data will be collected unless this consent has been given. The information sheets that will be used for these are based on standard forms developed in consultation with the VU’s privacy lawyers, and include information on what data will be processed, the purposes and the legal ground for processing, information on who will be able to access the data, the duration of data retention and how respondents can exercise their privacy rights. For verification purposes, the data for this project will be retained for 10 years after the last publication. After this, the data will be destroyed. The data will stored on storage infrastructure provided by the VU, which can only be accessed using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication. Data will be pseudonymized after it has been collected; any data containing directly identifying data (such as the raw, unpseudonymized data) will be stored separately from other data. The VU ensures that any storage solutions offered by third parties [e.g. Research Drive and Yoda by SURF, or qualtrics, name whichever apply] are governed by Data Processing Agreements, and that no personal data is stored outside the EEA [check if this last is true for the specific services you use!]. Ethics The researcher will work with the faculty of Social Sciences’ Research Ethics Review Committee (RERC) to ensure that the research is in line with ethics standards governing research at the faculty. The researcher will perform a scan of the research to flag ethics issues and will discuss any issues found with a representative of the RERC. [This really depends on the research. It is wise to do the self-check before and possibly consult your department’s RERC representative] Research Data Management Below are two examples of data management paragraphs that can be adapted and expanded on to suit most templates. There is one example for projects where the data will not be shared, and one where it will be. Example with no data sharing The data stored for this project will be stored on secure network storage provided by the VU, in accordance with VU’s ICT regulations. Access to the network storage is only granted to authorized personnel, using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication. In compliance with European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), no personal data will be stored without prior, explicit consent by the data subjects. After completion of the project, all data will be archived for ten years, in accordance with the FAIR principles. Because of the se sensitive nature of the topic, the data will not be shared publically, but only be accessible for verification purposes. If for this verification it is needed to share the data with staff outside the VU, this access will be governed by a data transfer agreement. Information on the access condition will be made public through a registry of the data set on VU’s Research Portal (which uses PURE). All data storage, archiving and registry solutions will be chosen in consultation with the faculty of social sciences’ data steward; these choices will be registered in a Data Management Plan before the start of the project. Example with data Sharing The data stored for this project will be stored on secure network storage provided by the VU, in accordance with VU’s ICT regulations. Access to the network storage is only ranted to authorized personnel, using strong passwords and multi-factor authentication. In compliance with European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), no personal data will be stored without prior, explicit consent by the data subjects. After completion of the project, pseudonymized data will be published on DataVerseNL, where it will be accompanied by rich metadata and full documentation. All data storage and archiving solutions will be chosen in consultation with the faculty of social sciences’ data steward; these choices will be registered in a Data Management Plan before the start of the project. Knowledge Security Knowledge scurity is an increasingly important topic, and one that you should address in your research. You may include a text in your proposal to emphasize you have considered this, base on the VU Knowledge Security Framework: The researchers will follow the VU Knowledge Security Framework to ensures that international cooperation can take place in a safe manner. The project will not imvolve persons, companies or organizations on the EU or UN sanction list and none of the research falls under the Dual-use regulation. The researcher will work with the VU’s knowledge security team to prevent misuse of the project’s research outputs. FSS RDM Resources Information when starting a new project FSS RDM Guidelines Data organization Data archiving RDM FAQ Overview of RDM Tools "],["new-rdm.html", "FSS Starting a new project: Ethics, Data Management and Privacy FSS RDM Resources", " FSS Starting a new project: Ethics, Data Management and Privacy When working with data from human respondents it is important to consider matters around ethics, data management and privacy before collecting (or analysing) any data. So when starting a new project or study – or significantly updating or expanding and existing one – it’s good to check whether the following things are in order: Ethics Review: the Research Ethics Review Committee provides a self-check that consists of a list of Yes/No questions that takes less than five minutes to complete. This scans for ethics issues, and advises on next steps. More information on Ethics Review can be found here. Research Data Management (RDM): you will need to consider what you do with your research data before you collect it, because you need to tell your respondents what you’re doing with it. Read the FSS RDM Guidelines for an overview of all Research Data Management requirements. The faculty advises you to use Yoda for storing, archiving and/or publishing your research data. Other options are available, check out the tools overview and/or the storage finder to find out more. Privacy: all data that can be linked in any way to living persons is considered personal data under GDPR. For most researchers this means: You must take appropriate technical and organization measures to secure data. For most data (including sensitive data, such as data on health, sexual preferences, political opinions etc.), Yoda and VU-managed devices offer sufficient protection. If you have sensitive data and want to use other storage solutions, it’s best to check in with the Faculty Data Steward or the RDM Support Desk to find what would work best for your needs. You should ensure that you have unambiguous informed consent of your research participants. Note that informed really means informed: you have to provide your participants with information about what you will do with the data, and what their rights are and how to excercise them. You can find templates for informing your particpants on the FSS Templates page. If you cannot obtain consent, you should contact the Faculty Data Steward to see how you can still legally work with your data. You must ensure that all data processing activities (collection, analysis, publishing, archiving, etc.) are entered in the VU’s central data processing registry. Currently, DMPs created using the VU template in DMP Online are linked automatically to this registry, meaning the researcher does not need to take additional action for this. If your DMP does not use the VU template (for example because your funder doesn’t accept it), there is a GDPR Registration Form on DMP Online that you should use to just enter the legally required information. If personal data is handled by third parties (e.g. a survey firm or data collection platform), you need to make sure the proper agreements are place to do this securely, for example Data Processing Agreements. The VU has these agreements in place for the use of VU-provided tools such as Yoda and Qualtrics. The Faculty Data Steward is there to help you with templates and getting legal advice for getting these agreements with other service providers and partners. Data Management Plan (DMP): all data collection done at the faculty should be covered by a Data Managment Plan (DMP). So once you have given all of the above some thought, you should start writing one, or adapt an existing one, by going to DMP Online. DMPs are living documents: you are encouraged to change them if what you plan to do with the data changes. FSS RDM Resources Information when starting a new project FSS RDM Guidelines Data organization Data archiving RDM FAQ Overview of RDM Tools "],["data-organization.html", "Data organization Introduction Use cases FSS RDM Resources", " Data organization This page is an extension of the FSS RDM Guidelines. Introduction Researchers of the Faculty of Social Sciences (FSS) are responsible for organizing their data in such a way that they can be archived without excessive effort. In general terms, the aim is to ensure that a fellow researcher can use the data without asking too many questions. This ensures that the results of the research can be verified if the need arises. Furthermore, should additional researchers be added to a project - or a researcher gets back from a long hiatus - they can get started quickly. This page provides several use cases (quantitative and qualitative) that serve as inspriration for organizing research data. Each use case gives an outline of a folder organization that is used during the research. These use cases serve as examples, researchers are free to use any organization that fits the needs of their research. Use cases Simple quantitative research project using Research Drive and Yoda Get the sample DMP for this use case here. This use case describes a fictional project using survey data. It uses Yoda for archiving only; for storage of data the project uses Research Drive. While Yoda is suitable for storage as well, Research Drive offers more fine-grained access control, which this fictional project needs to make sure student-assistants can’t access all information stored on the research drive. Research drive is used for day-to-day storage and synced to researcher’s devices using the OwnCloud software. The folder is organized as follows: Data Pseudonymized research data (access is granted as needed) Documentation Questionnaires, proposals, data management plan etc. (everyone in project can access) Papers One sub-folder per paper containing text, analysis scripts etc. for each paper. (access is granted as needed) Admin Project admin information, such as budgets; not accessible to students Yoda is used in this project for archiving, and is thus not synced to any devices. Directly following data collection, the raw data was pseudonymized. The pseudonymized data was stored on Research Drive. The raw, unpseudonymized data was archived on Yoda, assigned to the Vault and permanently deleted everywhere else. This ensures that a copy of the original data is always available (with a DOI), and minimizes the risk of leaking unpseudonymized data. Once a paper based on the data is published, a folder is created for that paper with all things that can be shared publicly. This folder copies the Yoda metadata of the root folder, making complying with the FAIR principles very easy. The folder is made public on Yoda and looks as follows: Raw data (Vault) Data files Documentation -Yoda metadata Replication files for each paper (Public): Author manuscript of paper Analysis and pseudonymization scripts Documentation Yoda metadata Note that the data itself is not made publicly available because of privacy concerns. The raw data is only archived for verification purposes. In case of doubts about the research integrity, the Raw Data’s DOI (listed in each paper’s data statement and replication files’ metadata) can be used to quickly identify the data set for verification purposes. Simple qualitative research project using Yoda Get the sample DMP for this use case here. The following is a basic qualitative project. All data is stored on Yoda. Once data collection is complete, the data folder is added to a non-public Yoda vault, a DOI of which is included in every paper. The documentation folder is made publicly available to allow re-use of topic lists etc. Yoda Raw Data (Vault, non-public) Interview recordings List of names with interviewees Data Pseudonymized interview transcripts Documentation (Vault, public) Sampling information Topic lists Ethics review information Blank informed consent form Papers: One sub-folder per paper containing text, figures, etc. for each paper. FSS RDM Resources Information when starting a new project FSS RDM Guidelines Data organization Data archiving RDM FAQ Overview of RDM Tools "],["data-archiving.html", "Archiving and/or publishing data How to apply the FAIR principles Findable Accessible Inter-operable Re-usable What to archive? FSS RDM Resources", " Archiving and/or publishing data This page is an extension of the FSS RDM Guidelines. When publishing research outputs, researchers at the Faculty of Social Sciences are expected apply the FAIR principles and to archive “all data that can be reasonably deemed necessary to verify the findings of the research”. This page aims to provide practical advice on how to achieve this. The first section discuss the constituent principles of FAIR data (Findability, Accessibility, Inter-operability and Re-usability), the second provides practical advice on what to archive, based on the Archiving Guidelines from the Deans of Social Sciences in the Netherlands. How to apply the FAIR principles The FAIR principles are a set of principles that guide researchers in making their data (or other research outputs) more valuable by increasing visibility, fostering collaboration, facilitating co-creation, and promoting transparency. To effectively implement the FAIR principles, it is beneficial to envision how your data will be reused, and then apply each principle accordingly. This involves ensuring discoverability of your data by end users, enabling easy access, facilitating integration with existing knowledge and workflows, and promoting its reuse. Given the diverse research traditions and approaches to data reuse within the faculty, there isn’t a universally prescribed approach for applying the FAIR principles. However, as a minimum requirement, all data utilized within FSS should be usable for verifying the findings presented in publications resulting from the data. This section provides practical pointers, aligned with the FAIR principles, on how you can make verification possible. Additionally, it presents further steps you can take to increase the impact of your research outputs. Findable Findable means people can find out about the existence of your dataset, and know where to find more information about it. Actions required to allow for verification: Register your data set in a registry like the VU Research Portal. (NB: you don’t need to upload your data set for this!) Ensure your data set is assigned a DOI (for example by adding it to a Vault on Yoda and publishing the metadata). More actions you can take to make your data set more Findable: Cite your data sets in your paper. Accessible Accessible means that there should be an established way to access your data. This does not mean you should publish your data, just that there is a clearly communicated and transparent procedure put in place to access the data. Actions required to allow for verification: Add a data availability statement in your publication that explains how, and under what conditions, the data can be accessed. Archive your data in a restricted-access repository like Yoda. More actions you can take to make your data set more Accessible: Make your data publicly available on Yoda, the OSF or DataVerseNL. Inter-operable Inter-operable means that someone else can use your data and combine it with their existing knowledge and workflows. Actions required to allow for verification: Use common, preferably open, file formats. Include documentation that can help people make sense of your data, such as codebooks, interviewer manuals, and topic lists. Wherever possible, use a language that can be understood by anyone who may reasonably be expected to use your research outputs. More actions you can take to make your data set more Inter-operable: Use standardized variables, coding schemes and vocabularies. Make sure the metadata of your datasets link to related datasets, publications and other relevant research outputs. Re-usable For your data to be re-usable, it needs to be clear what can and cannot happen with your data. Actions required to allow for verification: Include the informed consent sheets or privacy statements you provided your respondents, so that it is clear what they allow the data to be used for. Make sure that when you register your dataset, or deposit it into a repository, you include detailed information like author, topic, keywords, etc. See the VU’s minimal metadata standards. Note that Yoda requires you to include this information before submission. Actions you can take to make your data more Re-usable: Include detailed information, for example in a readme, on the provenance of your data: where it comes from, how was it has been collected and how it was processed. Include a license, like CC-BY or the DANS license, with your data; or set out a Data Sharing Agreement that exactly states what a recipient can do with the data. What to archive? The following materials should be archived, within one month after the publication date: A copy of the publication that uses the data. Most publications allow you to upload the submitted version (i.e. without the journal’s layout etc.). Raw data: unedited data files providing the most direct registration of the behaviour or reactions of test subjects/respondents. If the raw data files have been accessibly stored in an external archive (such as storage facilities at DANS), or if the data cannot be archived on university servers (for example due to IP restrictions) making reference to the location of the files will suffice. The VU researcher must ensure that such externally stored raw data will be available for verification purposes. Raw data may not be changed once they have been made digitally available. Analyzed data: the data files that were eventually analysed when preparing the article (e.g. an SPSS data file after transforming variables, after applying selections, etc.). This is not necessary if the raw data file was directly analysed, or if the analyzed data can be constructed without excessive effort from the raw data (for example by running a script). A description of the procedures to transform the raw data into analyzed data. This could be computer code (for example Atlas.ti, SPSS/JASP syntax file, MATLAB analysis scripts, R code) or a description of the steps taken in the qualitative analysis of primary research data, i.e. themes, domains, taxonomies, components. A description of the steps taken to process the analyzed data into results in the manuscript. This could be computer code or a description of the steps taken in the qualitative analysis of primary research data. Any documentation that can reasonably be deemed necessary in order for other researchers to understand the data and/or verify the research’s findings. The precise documentation depends on the methods used, but examples include: study design documents, interview guides, questionnaires, surveys, and topic lists. The materials must be available in the language in which the research was conducted. A readme file (metadata) describing which documents and files can be found where and how they should be interpreted. The readme file must be sufficiently clear, so that a relevant fellow researcher can verify the results discussed in the publication. The readme file must also contain the following information: Name of the person who stored the documents or files Division of roles among authors, indicating at least who analysed the data Date on which the manuscript was accepted, including reference Date/period of data collection Names of people who collected the data If relevant: addresses of field locations where data were collected and contact persons (if any) Whether the data is made open or not and if not, a valid reason for not opening up the data Documents received from the Research Ethics Review Committee: at least the result of the self-check, and if applicable result from a full review. If using personal data: information about the informed consent procedure, such as a privacy statement, or a blank informed consent form. FSS RDM Resources Information when starting a new project FSS RDM Guidelines Data organization Data archiving RDM FAQ Overview of RDM Tools "],["templates.html", "Templates Data Management Plans Informed consent Data Protection Impact Assessment Agreements FSS RDM Resources", " Templates Data Management Plans The University Library manages DMP Online so that all templates are up-to-date. It is advisable to use the VU template whenever possible (this is accepted by ZonMW and NWO instead of their own templates). The FSS Guidelines for Data Organization includes example DMPs that you can use for inspiration. For detailed guidance, you are encouraged to plan a consult with the Faculty Data Steward Informed consent Before collecting data, you are required to inform your respondents about what data you will collect, and what you intend to do with it. This can be through the use of a signed informed consent form, but this is not needed. In any case, the consent should be demonstrable. Ticking a box prior to an electroninc survey, clearly stating in a recording “I agree to be interviewed” (it is wise to separate this from the research data) or sending an email with the same text all are valid forms of consent. Whatever form you choose, you need to make sure your respondents are well informed. For this, there are the following documents: Informed Consent Form (English/Dutch): this form can given to respondents, and should be kept on file (preferably digitally) for the duration of the use of the data. Privacy Statement (English/Dutch): You can send interviewees a privacy statement by email prior to interviews, or put a link to a detailed privacy statement in a digital survey, and then ask the respondent whether they agree to be interviewed. If you collect particularly sensitive data (especially special categories) or do sensitive things with the data (like publishing) make sure to mention this in the question, so repsondents explicitly consent to this. The Faculty Data Steward can help you find the right way to inform your respondents and obtaining their consent. Data Protection Impact Assessment A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is a systematic process that helps identify, assess, and mitigate the risks associated with the processing of personal data. While it is never a bad idea to do a DPIA, it’s mandatory only in specific cases. To check whether you need to do a DPIA, you can fill out the pre-DPIA tool. If the result is that a DPIA is needed, you can contact the Faculty Data Steward to assist in drafting one, or have a look at the DPIA template. Agreements Data Sharing Statement: if students (or student assistants) work on sensitive data, it is wise to have them sign a statement that they will treat the data confidentially. For agreements with third parties, it’s best to be in touch with the Faculty Data Steward who can assist in liasing with the relevant departments at the VU. FSS RDM Resources Information when starting a new project FSS RDM Guidelines Data organization Data archiving RDM FAQ Overview of RDM Tools "],["fss-guidelines-rdm.html", "RDM: VU FSS guidelines for data management Introduction Stepping stones for good data management To whom do these guidelines apply? FSS RDM Resources", " RDM: VU FSS guidelines for data management Introduction As a faculty committed to excellence in the quality of the research our staff and students undertake, it is essential to have guidelines on good practice in Research Data Management (RDM) as part of our framework to support the integrity of our research. These FSS guidelines serve both as a means of developing and supporting a culture of good practice in data management and demonstrating that we are committed to a culture and environment where high standards are encouraged and expected. The purpose of these guidelines is to reduce work pressure by condensing the various, and often conflicting, regulations into one cohesive set of procedures that ensure maximum compliance. Details on the various underlying policies, and how they’re reflected in these guidelines, can be found here. Stepping stones for good data management Below are the guidelines for research data management in various stages of the research life cycle. In these guidelines, the following verbal forms are used: “shall”, “are required to” and “must” indicate a requirement; “should” indicates a recommendation; “may” indicates a permission; “can” indicates a possibility or a capability Planning &amp; Design Phase Researchers must follow the ethics review procedure of the Research Ethics Review Committee (RERC). Researchers must write a Data Management plan (DMP) using DMP Online, so that they can easily provide an up-to-date version to their department head at any moment. Researchers shall ensure that all planned activities with personal data comply with GDPR. In particular: They must plan to take appropriate technical and organization measures to secure data. Because of the wide variety of data used in the faculty, there is not one answer as to what measures are appropriate. Researchers should discuss the measures they take with colleagues, department heads, with the faculty data steward, privacy champion and/or the RDM support desk. They should ensure that all personal data is processed with full consent of all data subjects. If consent cannot be obtained, the researcher must ensure that there is another legal ground for processing the data. A privacy champion can assist with this. They shall ensure that if personal data is handled by third parties, the proper agreements are in place to do this securely, for example Data Processing Agreements. A privacy champion can assist with this. They shall ensure that all data processing activities (collection, analysis, publishing, archiving, etc.) are entered in the VU’s central data processing registry. Currently, DMPs created using the VU template in DMP Online are linked automatically to this registry, meaning the researcher does not need to take additional action for this. Contracts and agreements relating to the commissioning, funding and conduct of research, including data sharing, intellectual property rights, collaboration and non-disclosure agreements must all be processed through IXA-GO to ensure the safeguarding of (the autonomy of) your research. Such contracts must be signed by those with the appropriate delegated authority to do so on behalf of the University. The signature process is a chain of responsibility that starts with the submission from the Researcher for approval of the Head of Department, before the final signature from the Managing Director of the faculty or a member of the Executive Committee of the University. The Data Steward can advise researchers on how to manage this process. During ongoing projects Researchers shall keep their DMP up to date. Researchers should ensure that their data is stored in such a way that it can later be archived in accordance these guidelines (see section ‘after’, below) without excessive effort. This includes: Ensuring data is well-organized (for more information, see the page on data organization); Data is stored in the same place as vital documentation. Depending on the discipline of the researcher, this can include interviewer guides, questionnaires, topic lists, sampling information, power calculations, etc. Making sure the data is accompanied by a basic “Readme File” containing basic metadata such as an explanation of the purpose of the data, who is responsible for collecting it, and how the folder is organized, etc. Researchers must ensure that data is reliably, traceably and securely stored throughout the research life cycle. The VU offers storage infrastructure that meets these requirements (see the storage finder). If project data needs to be stored elsewhere (for example with project partners), researchers must ensure that the storage solution chosen meets these requirements. The data steward will help in this assessment. Researchers must take appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure any personal data. They can store directly identifiable data (see definitions, below) separately from other data, either by storing it on a different server or device, or through encryption. They must not store directly identifiable data longer than needed. Note that it may be impossible to remove directly identifying data without editing the raw data, which would compromise data integrity and provenance. In such cases, the directly identifiable data may be stored as long as long as the rest of the raw data. Researchers are expected to decide what data to destroy what data to keep. Researchers should discuss the choices they make with colleagues, department heads, with the faculty data steward, privacy champion and/or the RDM support desk, and record these choices in their DMP. After publication of results Archiving and Registration Researchers must ensure that the underlying data for each published empirical study (article, volume, book chapter, PhD thesis chapter, Research Master’s thesis, consultable internal report, etc.) is archived according to the following: What: all data that can be reasonably deemed necessary to verify the findings of the research. This includes the raw data (or a link to it, if secondary data was used), the data that was analysed and a description of all modifications to obtain the analysed data from the raw data (or the computer code used to perform these modifications) and full documentation of all steps involved in acquiring, processing and analysing the data. Detailed advice on what to archive can be found on the page on Data Archiving. When: the data must be archived no later than one month after the publication date, and be available until at least 10 years after the publication date. If this is not possible, a justification for deviating from this should be provided in the DMP. Where: a secure and reliable location that is accessible for verification (see the section on verification below), and that provides a persistent identifier. The archiving options provided by the VU satisfy these criteria. If data needs to be archived elsewhere (for example with project partners), researchers must ensure that the storage solution chosen meets these requirements. FSS follows the ERC’s approach “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. In practice, this means that public data is preferable, but that personal data does not need to be published1. Should researchers want to publish such data, they should ensure that they meet all legal and ethical requirements to do so, consulting with the faculty data steward if needed. Public data must always be accompanied by a license and, in case of personal data, information about the informed consent procedure. The decision to publish data or not should be explained in the DMP. Who: the first author of the publication is responsible for archiving the data. Second or later authors must know that the data have been carefully stored and how this has been arranged. This is particularly important if the first author does not work at FSS. For PhD candidates and research master’s students, the primary supervisor or the day-today supervisor respectively are responsible for archiving, but can delegate the work to the PhD candidate. Furthermore: Researchers should include in their published empirical studies a data statement containing the repository where the data is archived, the persistent identifier of the data, and instructions on how this data can be accessed and for what reasons. For sensitive data that is not published and that can only be accessed for verification purposes, a persistent email address may be provided where questions regarding the data can be directed. Researchers should ensure that all datasets that they produce are registered on the VU’s Research Portal, including sufficiently descriptive metadata, and the persistent identifier of the data set. Data verification In case of doubts about the research integrity of FSS research, the faculty board can decide that verification of archived (non-public data) is needed. In making this decision, the board shall balance the need for confidentiality and security with the interests of transparency. If it is decided that the data needs to be reviewed, the Faculty Board will then decide who will access the data while ensuring confidentiality of the data and work with IT, Legal and the Data Steward to ensure that this access is possible. Administrative procedures End of employment If a researcher leaves the VU, the department head should work with the researcher to ensure: That the data for any ongoing projects is properly stored according to these guidelines; That the data for any pending publications is properly archived according to these guidelines; That responsibility for any data sets archived by the researcher on VU infrastructure is transferred to an FSS colleague; and, That the researcher doesn’t lose access to data they need for their further career, if such access can be reasonably organized; for example through the signing of a data transfer agreement between the VU and the researcher’s new institution. Performance and appraisal reviews Adherence to these RDM guidelines will be discussed in performance and appraisal interviews. Formal final responsibility lies with the dean. To whom do these guidelines apply? These guidelines apply to all faculty staff members who conduct research in the context of a temporary or permanent employment contract, all PhD candidates who conduct research under the supervision of a professor, and all research master’s students. The guidelines do not apply to bachelor’s and one-year master’s students, unless their research results in an academic publication. Research conducted by bachelor’s and one-year master’s students falls under the formal responsibility of their supervisors.

Either the Faculty Data Steward or the Library’s RDM Support Desk. The Data Steward can help you best with questions that are specific to the work we do at the faculty, and with questions about specific grants; the RDM Support Desk is best equipped to deal with questions that could be asked by any VU researcher, for example about storage or archiving options. But both work together, so you can’t ask the wrong person. Where can I find more information about Research Data Management? We maintain a number of resources you can consult. At the VU level, there is the Research Data Support Portal which contains links to anything you might want to know about RDM, and the library maintains a series of Libguides explaining various topics related to the management of your data. At the faculty level, the data steward maintains a page giving advice that is specific to researchers in Social Sciences, including links to content you can use in proposals. I don’t have data. I only have observations. As RDM experts, we would say that observations are also a type of data. But that doesn’t really matter: in any case, you want to protect your observations, make backups of your observations and make sure that they are archived securely or shared with the world so that you can demonstrate you did your research well. That is to say, many important aspects of Research Data Management apply whether you call your observations data or not. Data Storage and Security Where should I store my data? Our advice is to use Yoda for storage and archiving, even for sensitive data, and only use VU-managed to devices to access the data. You can find other options in the Storage Finder, but check with the Data Steward if they work for the sensitivity level of your data. What is the difference between data storage and archiving? Data storage refers to where you save your data during the research. Your data storage option needs to be available to all collaborators, while still ensuring a sufficient level of security. Data archiving is where you keep your data after you are done with it, but it may need to be accessed when there are doubts about research integrity. Your data archiving solution can be publicly accessible if there is no sensitive data, or restricted-access if there is. The solution needs to be permanent and secure, so that the data cannot be changed, and any links to it will remain functional indefinitely. What security measures should I take? When using personal data (see below), per GDPR you should take “appropriate organizational and technical measures” to secure your data. The specific actions you should take are not set in stone; you should consider the potential consequences of a data breach, and whether or not the actions you would have to take to prevent them are reasonable. All VU storage solutions offer a number of security measures. For example, access is only allowed using passwords and multi-factor authentication. If your data is sensitive, there is a number of additional security measures you can take that reduce the risk of data leak, either by reducing the chance a leak happens, or by reducing the impact of a leak: Make sure people only have access to the data they need to do their task in your project. For example, with Research Drive it is possible to give each collaborator only access to the folders they need. Don’t sync data from your Research Drive to your personal computer if you don’t have to. For example, once you are done with your raw data, having it on your personal computer only increases the chance that your data is leaked: keep the raw data online-only, and only sync the processed (pseudonymized) data you are working on. Make sure everyone in your project is trained in security procedures, such as strong passwords, not clicking attachments in emails from unknown senders etc. Pseudonymize your personal data by removing any directly identifying information, so that any data that is leaked is less likely to be linked to your respondents. If you need to keep the directly identifying data (for example, because it’s part of your raw data which you want to keep to demonstrate the provenance of your data, or because you need to contact participants for follow-up), make sure this data will not be leaked at the same time as the pseudonymized data. You can do this either by storing it separately or by encrypting it. See “When should I pseudonymize?”, below. Encrypt your data, so that if someone accesses the hard drive that holds your data, they can’t read the data. Software such as Cryptomator makes encryption very convenient. Encryption does have a large downside: loss of your password means loss of the data. You can use a password manager to minimize this risk, but it is wise to think twice before deciding to use encryption. For help on deciding what measures are appropriate for your data, and with the practical implementation of any of these, you can contact your data steward. Personal Data What is personal data? Personal data is any data that can be directly or indirectly linked to a living person. You can directly link data to a person if a direct identifier like their name, phone number, email address etc. is included in the data. You can indirectly link the data if you can combine the data with another piece of data or information to find the person who the data is about. This is possible for more data than you think, so if you collected data from people, it’s safe to assume your data is personal data, even if you remove things like names, phone numbers and addresses. What is the difference between anonymization and pseudonymization? Both these terms mean that you make it less likely that the data that you have can be linked to your respondents, increasing the security of your data. In case of pseudonymization, you remove the possibility of directly linking the data to your respondents, by removing things like names and addresses from the data. Anonymization removes entirely the possibility of linking your data to your respondents, both directly and indirectly. This means that the data is no longer personal data, and GDPR does not apply. However, anonymization is difficult and we don’t usually recommend it (see below). When should I pseudonymize? There is no “one-size-fits-all” answer to this: in general, we do recommend pseudonymizing your data, but in some cases the benefits of pseudonymization may not outweigh the costs. These costs and benefits depend on the nature of your data. A tabular data set is easily pseudonymized by dropping certain variables and generating random identifiers, so it should probably be pseudonymized. On the other hand, for an audio recording it may be practically impossible to edit out all the names. Likewise, the benefits differ; for a dataset containing speeches by famous politicians, leaving out the names will not make identification appreciably more difficult, and yield no security benefits as the data is publicly available anyway. Whether the costs of pseudonymization outweigh the benefits thus depends on the specific project. If you feel the costs don’t outweigh the benefits, feel free to contact your Data Steward to see if they agree, and make sure to write down your reasoning in your Data Management Plan. Should I keep my unpseudonymized data? If so, where? If possible, directly identifying data is kept completely separate from research data. For example, your Qualtrics form should not contain fields for email addresses if that’s not needed for the research itself. If you need email addresses to send rewards, use a separate form. In this way, you can destroy any personal data as soon as possible, without editing the raw data. However, this is not always possible, since some times the directly identifying data is integral part of the raw data (for example in video recording). In these cases you should not destroy the data, because you should keep an unedited version of your data for transparency purposes. This raw copy of the data should be stored safely, and in such a way that a data breach doesn’t necessarily mean a breach of both pseudonymized and unpseudonymized data. Examples are: Store the raw data on a separate server (however, most research programs don’t have two servers available). Store both raw and pseudonymized data on the same server (or device) but encrypt the raw data. You should make sure that you can’t lose your encryption password, or else you lose your raw data. Keep both both pseudonymized data on the same server, but make sure the raw data is never synced to personal computers or other devices (for example by adding it to a Yoda Vault). This way, the raw data is protected from the most common data breaches (e.g. losing a laptop in the train). Why is it so hard to anonymize data? Anonymization is potentially very attractive because it removes the need to comply with GDPR. However, it is difficult to combine with the goals of researchers in practice. This is because it will almost always involve making data less detailed, which will harm your ability to draw conclusions from the data. To see why, first consider a quantitative data set about work satisfaction, containing gender and age of all respondents. If I know my colleague is a respondent in this survey, I may be able to infer things about my colleague from the public data set. If only one person in the data set matches his age and gender, I have successfully (indirectly) identified him in the data set. If there are multiple people matching his age and gender are present, but none has indicated liking their colleagues, I have still inferred something about him, and may become very disappointed! To prevent me from identifying of my colleague, you as the researcher should thus ensure that there are no unique combinations of age and gender (for example by using broader age bins) and that within each combination of age and gender there is sufficient variation in answers that nothing can be inferred about individuals (so there is always a mix of people who like their colleagues and those who don’t). It is easy to see how the binning of variables may lead to less precision in the analysis, and how difficult it is to ensure that proper variation exists in all (combinations of) variables. There are ways to do this, but it is usually more attractive to keep the data as personal data, even if this puts restrictions on data use due to GDPR. Qualitative data sets are usually so rich that all observations are unique, and thus potentially identifiable by someone who knows your respondents well (or otherwise has detailed information on them). Qualitative data is therefore usually impossible to fully anonymize, though pseudonymization may be possible. I know it’s difficult, but I would still like to anonymize my data, how do I do this? That’s great! A good place to start is the R package sdcMicro. Your data steward may be able to help out when using it. Alternatively, there is Amnesia. Note that anonymization means modifying your data, so if you want to anonymize data for replication purposes, not all analyses that you did with your unanonymized data can be fully replicated using anonymized data. This is acceptable, if explained properly in your paper (e.g. in a footnote). I don’t have informed consent forms for my research. Is that bad? It’s not necessarily bad, because written informed consent is only required by law in cases of health research (where WMO applies). You can have participants give informed consent orally if you’re not doing WMO research, but make sure you record it and store it safely. You can ask advice from your data steward or privacy champion if you will ask oral informed consent. There are also other legal grounds (than informed consent) on which you can do research. However, if you should have asked informed consent, but did not do so, that could be bad and we recommend that you contact your privacy champion as soon as possible. Sharing Data and Notes Can I publish personal data? Yes you can. But make sure: Your respondents have given explicit consent to publishing the data; To use VU provided services, such as OSF, Yoda or DataverseNL; Not to publish more than needed. In particular, the data should be pseudonymized; and, You publish nothing sensitive, and your respondents run no risk because of the data you publish. I don’t want to share my data, because participants in my research (or other people) may get in trouble. In that case, it is not ethical to share them and we recommend that you do not do so. It is still important to archive your data for verification purposes. The Yoda Vault exists for this exact purposes: data stored there can only ever be accessed by other researchers who have a reasonable request for verification. In your DMP you can outline your reasoning why you don’t want to share your data. Nobody else but me will understand my notes. Then why should I share them with others? If your notes contain personal data, you should not probably not share them at all, but you should still archive them so that it can be verified that your research has been done in the way you claim in your publications. If the notes do not contain personal data, sharing your notes is a good way of opening up your research. It’s best not to assume no one is interested in your notes. Even if you think your notes are unreadable, someone may still find them of great use. For example, someone who wants to do research into how researchers take notes, or someone studying early 21st century hand writing. If you want to share your notes in a more useful and readable way, but are worried about the workload you could also consider cleaning up only a subset of them and sharing that. Small steps to more transparent science can very worthwhile! In the informed consent forms, I didn’t ask if data may be reused by other researchers. Can I share them now? In this situation, you cannot share the personal data with researchers outside the VU. There are two things that you could do: If possible, go back to your participants and ask them if other researchers may reuse their data; If this turns out to be impossible, anonymize the data. Then the data are no longer personal. We do recommend that you ask your data steward for help, because this can be tricky (see above: Personal Data &gt; Why is it so hard to anonymize data?). If neither these are possible, you can’t share the data. This is one of the reasons why it’s so important that you write a Data Management Plan before collecting data, so you will have thought of these things in advance. Can I be forced to publish my data because of the WOB? The Wet Openbaarheid van Bestuur (WOB) only applies to public entities, so not to the Stichting VU (the VU is unique among Dutch universities in this). However, the WOB may apply to the commissioner of your research, for example if your research is commissioned by the national government, or about the functioning of local governments or the police. In these cases, the WOB most likely still doesn’t apply to research data, since there are numerous grounds for exemption, such as the protection privacy. Get in touch with your Data Steward if you’re still worried about this. I’m afraid that other researchers will misuse my data. How can I prevent that from happening? It depends on what you mean by “misuse”. If this concerns using your data commercially, you can add a license to your data that specifies non-commercial use only. The same goes for data that may not be remixed. If, however, the misuse can occur simply by the nature of your data, then we recommend that you speak to a data steward and/or a representative of the ethical review committee to discuss your doubts and your options. Data Management Plans (DMPs) metadata and FAIR Data How can I start writing a Data Management Plan? You can log into DMPOnline with your VU credentials to start writing a DMP. It has templates of most funders which are kept up to date by the university library. If you need any help (for example with the technical terms used in many DMP templates), feel free to contact the faculty data steward. Where can I find examples of Data Management Plans? DMPOnline has a large number of Data Management Plans from which you can get inspiration for your own DMP. What DMP template should I use? For projects involving personal data, it is recommended that you use the VU template. You can currently only access the VU Template by ticking the box “No funder associated with this plan or my funder is not listed”. This template is accepted by ZonMW and NWO. By using this template you make sure that the information of your project can be used in the “GDPR registry”, which the VU is obligated to maintain and provide to the privacy authorities on request. What if my funder doesn’t accept the VU template? You can make use of the template provided by your funder (most funders’ templates are on DMP Online). To make sure your project is included in the GDPR registry, you need to fill out the VU GDPR registration for for reseatch, which you can find as a template on DMP Online: select “Create Plans”, and then make sure to tick the box “No funder associated with this plan or my funder is not listed”. I never created a Data Management Plan. Is that bad? There are some situations in which writing a DMP is mandatory. For example, if you have received a grant, you almost always have to write a DMP. The Faculty of Social Sciences also requires you to write a DMP for any new research project you start. And DMPs are sometimes necessary components of various requests, such as an ethics application (for a full procedure) and a storage application (in some cases). And obviously, if you are following the course “Writing a DMP”, you have to write a DMP to complete the course. Now, for research that is already underway, writing a DMP is a good practice, but not doing so is not necessarily bad. Writing a DMP, though, is a good way to keep you accountable and not let things come down to chance and luck. And it helps you to avoid last-minute panic. Although you are already under way with the research, it can still be a good idea to write a DMP. You can get in touch with your data steward or the RDM Support Desk if you still want to do it. What is metadata? Metadata is data about your data. It is simply information such as authors, colloborators, dates, description, key words. It is not the data itself. So even if your data itself is very sensitive, the metadata may be freely published (though in some cases metadata can be sensitive as well). What metadata and documentation should I include with my data? If you use Yoda, you can simply fill out the metadata form included in the portal. Otherwise, you can use this file to write a “readme file” that contains the same information. As for documentation: this is very much dependent on your data. A useful excercise is to imagine yourself having to take a break from research for a few years. What information would you need to get back into understanding your data again? This can include questionnaires, codebooks, field manuals, topic lists, proposals, ethics applications, data management plans etc. What metadata standard should I use? Some DMP templates ask this, but it’s usually not something you as resarcher should worry about. You should let this depend on the service you use to register, archive and/or publish your data set. The forms on those services will ensure that everyhting is stored according to a certain standard. PURE uses a standard called CERIF; Yoda uses DataCite. What does FAIR data stand for? FAIR stands for Findable, Accessbile, Inter-operable, and Re-usable. Many of these sub-elements of FAIR cover a wide spectrum of possibilities: some data can be made more easily accessible than others, for example. Advice on how to make your data FAIR can be found in the FSS Archiving Guidelines My funder wants me to make my data FAIR, but I can’t share the data because of privacy concerns. This is not a problem. Data needs to be Accessible. This means that there is a well-defined procedure for accessing the data, for example in cases where there are doubt about scientific integrity. Archiving your data securely on Yoda is sufficient for this. "],["rdm-tools.html", "RDM: Tools FSS RDM Resources", " RDM: Tools The figure below gives an overview of the tools that are available throughout the research lifecycle. Faculty-specific advice and guidance on which tools are recommended is provided in the table below. If you would like to use other tools, feel free to contact the Faculty Data Steward for more information. More general information about the data management tools provided by the VU can be found on the Research Data Support Portal. Information about costs can be found here. Tool FSS Guidance How to get started Storage Finder The storage finder offers information about all storage options offered for research data, even those not typically used in the faculty of social sciences https://vu.nl/en/research/storagefinder DMP Online All work you do on data needs to be covered by a DMP in the VU template on DMP Online. This is because both your department head and the Dutch privacy regulator need to be able to have insight into what happens to the data used in the faculty. This is facilitated by DMP Online. If, for whatever reason, you have a DMP elsewhere, you can fill out the shortened \"GDPR registration form\" on DMP Online to ensure transparency. Visit https://dmponline.vu.nl, log in with your institutional credentials, and start writing! If you are not sure about what to enter, please don’t spend hours researching the answer: you can always schedule a session with the Faculty Data Steward. Yoda Yoda is the preferred solution for storing and archiving data at FSS. It is rated for sensitive data, can be used with (external) collaborators, and allows for secure access both on and off campus. Data can be added to a \"vault\" to preserve a persistent copy. This copy can be assigned metadata, a DOI,and (optionally) be published. Visit yoda.vu.nl, fill out the request form, and the functional manager of yoda will schedule an intake with you. Research Drive Research Drive can be used to store data during your research, but, unlike yoda, can’t be used for archiving or publishing. It does have two advantages over Yoda. Firstly, it offers fine-grained access control to sub-folders. This allows you to specify folder which team members can access it. For example, you can choose not to give students access to senstive materials. Secondly, it offers better syncing, allowing you use more effectively offline. Because of the lack of archiving options, you will mostl likely have to combine Research Drive with Yoda. Visit https://services.vu.nl/esc?id=kb_article&amp;sysparm_article=KB0012856 for more information and a request form. OSF The OSF is great for making your work more transparent, pre-resgistering studies and publishing data. There is much information on OSF.io; VU has an institutional account with the OSF, meaning you can log in with your VU credentials. Teams / SURF Drive While Teams and SURF Drive are great for collaboration with colleagues and students, we recommended not to use them for storing research data since the backup and security features of other storage solutions such as Yoda and Research Drive are much more robust. Access to Teams and SURF Drive is standard for all employees.
